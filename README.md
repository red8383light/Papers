Over the past few years, there has been a growing trend in using sites such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter as a single sign-on method to login into other websites (Wang, Chen, & Wang, 2012, p. 365).  This is a great idea to be able to use a single login credential to access multiple accounts.  This is the same principal as the single sign-on method.  However, people tend to use insecure passwords and/or reuse passwords and are not fully aware of phishing attacks... so trying to be safe while using the single sign-on method is difficult.  These three issues are common amongst average users and even for those with knowledge of these kinds of issues as phishing attacks can be difficult to detect.  Lastly, even though weak passwords, password reuse, and phishing attacks are not an exclusive threat to the single sign-on method, they make the use of sites like Facebook, Google and Twitter as a single sign-on an unsafe option.
